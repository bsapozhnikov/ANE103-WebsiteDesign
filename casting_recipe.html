<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol class="list-group">
	<li>Place 19th century damaged plaster cast on table.</li>
	<li>Fill the space between the cast and the table with modeling clay and make sure the cast is completely level.</li>
	<li>Mix up white glue and powered marble, or substitute gypsum cement for the powdered marble.</li>
	<li>Fill any holes/chips/seams between panels of the cast with glue+marble mixture.</li>
	<li>Correct any casting imperfections on the cast with sculpting tools.</li>
	<li>Mix up liquid silicon (equal parts A and B) and pour silicon on the cast.</li>
	<li>Brush the silicon into the details of the cast with an aggressive brush stroke.</li>
	<li>Apply multiple layers of silicon to the cast, waiting approximately 20 minutes between layers so that each layer is tacky but not dry.  Apply enough layers so that there is about 3/8 of an inch of silicon on top of the cast.</li>
	<li>Make sure that the silicon covers the sides of the cast as well and covers part of the table to make a “flange.”</li>
	<li>Brush Sonite Wax on top of the mold surface.</li>
	<li>Spray Ease Release 200 on top of the mold surface.</li>
	<li>Mix up Free Form Air Epoxy Putty (Mix parts A and B). It will have consistency of play-dough.  Roll into balls and push balls on top of mold until entire mold surface is covered with putty.  You’ll have about 30 minutes to do this until the putty sets.</li>
	<li>Remove the mother mold (putty layer).</li>
	<li>Remove the flexible mold (silicon layer).</li>
	<li>Place silicon layer inside mother mold.  It should fit perfectly within.</li>
	<li>Lay down a layer of Ease Release 200 inside silicon mold.</li>
	<li>Spray paint primer into mold as well.</li>
	<li>Pour Feather Light Urethene Resin (Mix parts A and B) into mold and wait for it to dry.</li>
	<li>Flip mold upside down to release Resin cast.  You’ve now created a new cast.</li>
    <li>Paint the cast. Enjoy.</li>
