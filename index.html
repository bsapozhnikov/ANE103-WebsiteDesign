                    <p>Welcome to ANE 103: Ancient Lives.  This course explores the earliest human civilizations in the region of Mesopotamia and the Levant c. 3500-300 bce – the territory now covered by the nations of Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan. Few elements in the way we live and organize ourselves today are to be taken for granted. There are – and have always been – a wealth of ways in which humans live. But biologically we are the same as our ancestors of 5500 years ago, at the dawn of history. Any likeness or difference between ‘us and them’ is therefore likely to be a product of history and culture. ‘Ancient Lives’ builds upon this realization to inspire a critical way of thinking about society in the broadest possible scope. Areas explored during the course are selected for their relevance across the range of contemporary life – they include freedom, music, public health, food, jurisprudence, trade, the visual arts, science, sexuality, religion and political power. Students learn about how societies and individuals have dealt with change on multiple levels, from large-scale societal revolutions to personal transformation. Having taken this course, students gain a fundamental understanding and appreciation of human life in the broadest scope, as well as of their own lives as a part of history. They will be able to critically assess contemporary discourses on the study of ‘the other’ in past and present; engage with core concepts of human society, such as justice, beauty, value and belief; be familiar with examples of classical social theory and thinkers through concrete cases in which their work has been applied to or shaped by the study of the past; and acquire skills in presenting scholarly work to a general audience. This is a website with a compilation of projects done by students who took ANE 103 in the fall of 2015.  You can look at the projects by clicking the links below.  There are 5 categories: laboratory, casting, web blog, exhibit, and website design.  Further information on the course can be found by clicking on the course syllabus. <br>
