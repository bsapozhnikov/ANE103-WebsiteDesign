                <h1>God Bless Mesopotamia:</h1><h2>The God-King Relationship in the Stele of Hammurabi and Its Contemporary Implications<br><i>by Emily Zauzmer</i></h2>
		<div class="panel web-presentation-panel megpedit">
		    <p>
			The relief atop the Stele of Hammurabi – a basalt law-code created at the behest of King Hammurabi (1792-1750 BCE) in Sippar in the 18th century BCE and moved to the Susa acropolis by a prince of Elam in the 12th century BCE – gives modern viewers deep insights into the hierarchical relationship between royalty and divinity in Mesopotamia (Béatrice). But the idea of an earthly sovereign bowing to the commands of heavenly lords is not exclusive to the past. This notion has modern-day parallels, suggesting that human understanding of the role of deities in statehood is a universal, nuanced phenomenon rather than a specific, one-dimensional characteristic of the Ancient Near East.<br>
			The Stele of Hammurabi’s relief depicts a meeting of the Mesopotamian sun god, Shamash, and his most valued servant, Hammurabi (Slanski 105, <i>Laws of Hammurabi</i>). This meeting is not one of equals: Hammurabi stands; Shamash sits. Hammurabi appears reasonably tall; Shamash would tower over him were he to rise. Hammurabi wears the hat of kingship; Shamash dons the more notable hat of godliness. The most salient symbol of Hammurabi’s inferiority to Shamash is the nose-touching gesture that Hammurabi performs, an ancient sign of deference. The central rod and ring (traditional architectural tools that symbolize exactitude) that Shamash hands Hammurabi drive this message home (Slanski 105-106). Yale historian Kathryn E. Slanski views these figural elements in conversation with each other. She explains, “What is important here is not so much the emblem in and of itself, but the entire composition: the god of justice is displaying to the pious king the tools for laying just foundations, an image that complements Hammurabi’s claim in the Prologue to have ‘been called by the gods to establish just ways in the land’” (Slanski 106). Even the original spatial context of the relief supports the gods’ omnipotence, for Sippar was considered the city of Shamash (Béatrice). Hammurabi may own the tools with which to institute order, but his ownership is conditional upon the approval of Shamash, the guardian of literal light (the sun) and figurative light (fairness). <br>
			There is a third actor in the scene: the viewer. The considerable height of the Stele of Hammurabi at eight feet high places the everyday citizen at the lowest level of humanity (Price 468). Thus, the viewer is reminded that though the king cowers before the gods, the inferior common people are expected to cower before all of them. (Mesopotamia boasts a long tradition of equating height to respect: The Hittite take on <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i> states that the titular character stood eleven yards tall (Goff 31).) By subtly showing the viewer his lesser ranking before the king and the gods, the Stele of Hammurabi straddles both sides of the legal process, serving the dual role of morality-enforcer and punishment-giver: It reminds the people to follow society’s principles with its imagery, but if the people do not do so, it provides a variety of punishments (for offenses including adultery, violence, fugitive slaves, and more) with its text (“The Oldest Law-Book” 156).<br>
			As is so often true, history is not simply a static relic of the past – it engages in a powerful conversation with the present. Thousands of years after the creation of the Stele of Hammurabi, states continue to grapple with the place of godly beings in human governments. Take, for example, the United States of America. On the one hand, America draws a sharp line between religion and government that represents a profound departure from the unquestionably religious Mesopotamian system: America views the people and the Constitution that protects them as the ultimate source of the president’s power; Mesopotamia considered the gods as the origin of the king’s rulership. America was founded upon the principle of separation of church and state; in Mesopotamia, the temple was the focal point of the state. But on the other hand, America shares with Mesopotamia an understanding of the divine as the supporter of the head of state’s power: When presidents enter office, they swear upon the Bible that they will execute the office’s responsibilities. When presidents prepare for their inaugurations, they start their mornings in church rather than in places of government. When presidents conclude their State of the Union addresses, they ask for the blessings of God for the nation (Paraschivescu 26-31). Clear parallels can be drawn between the control that gods exerted over Mesopotamian rulership and the sense of support that a relationship with God offers American presidents.<br>
			Ultimately, Mesopotamian and American interpretations of the position of supreme beings in government are most linked by their shared purpose. Mesopotamia’s and America’s similar uses of religious approval confirm that – throughout time and through space – leaders have frequently used the idea of divine endorsement to legitimize their power in the eyes of the people. Such a propagandist decision reveals a measure of nervousness on the rulers’ part, a nervousness that the citizens will not view their administrations with a sense of validity unless the cosmos looks upon the ruler favorably. From King Hammurabi to President Obama to countless other leaders, a connection to the divine never hurt the metaphorical poll numbers of a mighty yet mortal ruler, for deities give rulership what mere men cannot – a feeling of inevitability.
