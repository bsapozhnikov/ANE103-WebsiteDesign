					<h1>STEP 1</h1>
					<p>Here we have included all of the ingredients used in the experiment, as taken from an ancient Mesopotamian recipe. Included are pomegranates, mint, cumin, myrrh, fish oil, ghee (a form of clarified butter), pomegranate juice, and cedar oil.</p>

					<h1>STEP 2</h1>
					<p>This image shows some of the preperation that was needed to create the recipes. Here, we see one of the researching students use a mortar and pestle to grind up and puree the mint for one of the recipes, following a tradition that goes back thousands of years.</p>

					<h1>STEP 3</h1>
					<p>Here we see modern technology merging with the recipies of the past. In order to create a homogenous solution for their recipe (as it would yield the best results) the students used a vacuuming filter to remove both large clumps and bacteria that could have already infected the recipes.</p>
				</li>
				<li id="1950">

					<h1>STEP 4</h1>
					<p>After preparing the recipes, they were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of bacteria. To test this, the recipes were mixed into flasks full of bacteria and incubated in a rotary shaker, shown here.</p>
				</li>
				<li id="1971">
					<img src="images/5.jpg"  width="50%" />
					<h1>STEP 5</h1>
					<p>As the testing was occuring, a spectrophotometer was used to measure the concentration of bacteria within each sample. This works by measuring the light absorption of the mixture as a light is shined through it. As the bacteria grow and multiply, the absorption increases, allowing less and less light to go through.</p>
				</li>
				<li id="1971">
					<img src="images/6.jpg" height = "100%" />
					<h1>STEP 6</h1>
					<p>Here we see the visible color difference of samples taken at different times as the incubation proceeded. We can see that bacteria continued to grow as the recipes were tested. These samples are loaded into the spectrophotometer to measure absorption (and from absorption, concentration).</p>

			<h1>Pomegranates 101: Mesopotamian Recipes in the Modern Era<br><br></h1>
			<p>The civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia developed a significant medical corpus, and their documentation of medical recipes allows modern experimenters to quantify their efficacy. A common ingredient in Mesopotamian medicines was the pomegranate; recipes called for various parts of the plant, including juice, root, and peel (Scurlock, 2014). These recipes were for the purpose of treating a range of diseases, from aches and burns to those likely caused by microbes. Modern experimenters have found that the use of pomegranates probably did assist in alleviating symptoms and curing diseases. Pomegranates have shown promise in healing second-degree burns (Ma, 2015) and in killing the periodontopathogens which cause dental plaques (Bhadbhade, Acharya, Rodrigues, & Thakur, 2011). Components of pomegranate juice which have successfully been used to kill E. Coli and other common bacteria also have been identified as candidate antimicrobial drugs (Naziri, Rajaian, & Firouzi, 2012). <br><br>

Other substances mentioned often in Mesopotamian medical textbooks have also been shown to have antimicrobial effects. The leaves of mint, thyme, and other herbs were shown to significantly reduce bacterial growth (Oral, Vatansever, Guven, & Gulmez, 2008), as was cumin seed (Shetty, Singhal, & Kulkarni, 1994). Several essential oils, including cypress (Romeo, De Luca, Piscopo, & Poiana, 2008) and juniper oils, were shown to possess both antibacterial and antifungal properties (Filipowicz, Kaminski, Kurlenda, Asztemborska & Ochocka, 2003). Myrrh oil was found to act as both an anesthetic and an antibacterial agent (Dolara et al., 2000), and the omega-3 fatty acids present in fish oil are known also to have antibacterial effects (Som & Radhakrishnan, 2011). While each of these ingredients has been separately shown to be effective in killing microorganisms, it has not yet been studied whether these ingredients are more effective in combination. The purpose of our study is to test whether the treatments outlined in Mesopotamian medical textbooks are more effective than pomegranate juice alone.</p><br><br><br>
