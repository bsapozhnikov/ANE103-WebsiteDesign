					<h1>STEP 1</h1>
					<p>Here we have included all of the ingredients used in the experiment, as taken from an ancient Mesopotamian recipe. Included are pomegranates, mint, cumin, myrrh, fish oil, ghee (a form of clarified butter), pomegranate juice, and cedar oil.</p>
				</li>
				<li id="1930">

					<h1>STEP 2</h1>
					<p>This image shows some of the preperation that was needed to create the recipes. Here, we see one of the researching students use a mortar and pestle to grind up and puree the mint for one of the recipes, following a tradition that goes back thousands of years.</p>
				</li>
				<li id="1944">

					<h1>STEP 3</h1>
					<p>Here we see modern technology merging with the recipies of the past. In order to create a homogenous solution for their recipe (as it would yield the best results) the students used a vacuuming filter to remove both large clumps and bacteria that could have already infected the recipes.</p>
				</li>
				<li id="1950">
					<img src="images/4.jpg"  height="50%" />
					<h1>STEP 4</h1>
					<p>After preparing the recipes, they were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of bacteria. To test this, the recipes were mixed into flasks full of bacteria and incubated in a rotary shaker, shown here.</p>
				</li>
				<li id="1971">
					<img src="images/5.jpg"  height="50%" />
					<h1>STEP 5</h1>
					<p>As the testing was occuring, a spectrophotometer was used to measure the concentration of bacteria within each sample. This works by measuring the light absorption of the mixture as a light is shined through it. As the bacteria grow and multiply, the absorption increases, allowing less and less light to go through.</p>
				</li>
				<li id="1971">
					<img src="images/6.jpg"  height="70%" />
					<h1>STEP 6</h1>
					<p>Here we see the visible color difference of samples taken at different times as the incubation proceeded. We can see that bacteria continued to grow as the recipes were tested. These samples are loaded into the spectrophotometer to measure absorption (and from absorption, concentration).</p>
