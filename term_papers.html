                <h1>Term Papers</h1>

                <hr>

                <p>Two graduate students wrote term papers on the class.  The abstracts of their papers are shown below.</p>

                <hr>

                    <h2>Abstract <i>by Laura Taronas</i></h2>
                    <p>This essay sets out to examine the images of Neo-Assyrian queens within the artistic realm in comparison to those of two queens from the Amarna period in Egypt. These two periods were chosen for comparison due to the surge in prominence that depictions of royal women experienced during these times. Although these eras are not contemporaneous, the fact that royal women were displayed more often and with greater similarities to royal men suggests that there were parallel social and political factors that existed in both of these societies in order to allow for such a change to occur. The corpus of images from which to choose during the Neo-Assyrian period is still extremely small as there are only depictions of two Neo-Assyrian queens that have survived to this day (Ornan, 2002: 463). As a result, these two queens, Liballi-šarrat and Naqia, have been chosen as the focus for the Mesopotamian queens. Appropriate Egyptian counterparts were selected based on the roles that they fulfilled: Tiye mirrors Naqia’s position as an important royal mother and Nefertiti reflects Liballi-šarrat’s role as a female consort who is known from the most artistic depictions of her time. As the Neo-Assyrian women each had such limited artistic representations, each queen is discussed in relation to a single artwork that seemed to be particularly representative of the themes and roles that are associated with her. Each composition will be discussed in terms of its symbolism and possible political and social meanings in order to determine the role that gender played in these artworks as well as how these images convey particular messages about these women’s’ positions in society. </p>

                    <h2>Abstract <i>by In&ecircs Torres</i></h2>
                    <p>Why study the role of women in politics in ancient states such as Egypt and Assyria, if it is clear that the reins of power were held by a male, all-powerful king, who not only embodied the state itself but was also the one mortal capable of imposing divine will on earth? It has been stated by many scholars that women had no real power in such societies, and that the only way they could have possibly influenced politics in their milieu was through the manipulation of a weak king. This is, however, not entirely true, and such wide-spread bias towards the position and importance of royal women in both Egypt and Mesopotamia makes it all the more necessary to look at the surviving evidence with different eyes.

                    The two periods being analyzed here, the Egyptian New Kingdom and the Mesopotamian Neo-Assyrian Empire, were fairly similar in terms of state structure (both were organized in a hierarchical society with a king as its head and embodiment of state and of a divine will, helped by a large, almost exclusively male bureaucracy in ruling their empires), and are fairly well-documented (textually, iconographically, and archaeologically), therefore constituting suitable case-studies for a cross-comparison.

                    This paper aims to analyze the positions, importance and roles of queens, queen-mothers, and princesses - what do we actually know about these women? They were certainly respected figures, for these are the mothers, wives, and daughters of the kings, who are the ultimate source of power and authority in the state; but what else can one learn from the available sources? What does the documentation tell us and what can we infer from it? And what can we learn about the society in which they lived in? What is therefore aimed is to paint a picture of the power and political importance that royal women had in Egypt and Mesopotamia in the New Kingdom and Neo-Assyrian Empire.</p>
